# YT-Advertising-Sales-Prediction-Using-R
This project aims to predict future sales based on the advertising budget spent on YouTube, as part of an advertising experiment that also includes Facebook and newspaper advertising. The dataset used contains 200 observations of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for the three media, along with the corresponding sales figures. The goal is to build a regression model using R that can accurately predict sales based on the budget spent on YouTube advertising, and compare its performance to models based on Facebook and newspaper advertising.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the impact of three advertising media (YouTube, Facebook, and newspaper) on sales. The data are the advertising budget in thousands of dollars along with the sales. The advertising experiment has been repeated 200 times with different budgets, and the observed sales have been recorded.
# Methodology

The project involves the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between the variables and identify any outliers or missing values.

2. Model Selection and Training using various regression models in R, including simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.

3. Model Evaluation and Comparison using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess the performance of the models.


# Repository Structure

• `src/`: Contains code.
